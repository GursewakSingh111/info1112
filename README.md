## Development Environment

In this course, we will use either CodeLite or Visual Studio (Not Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code are two different softwares.). 

- CodeLite Setup: [[1, Section 2]](https://www.udemy.com/course/beginning-c-plus-plus-programming/learn/lecture/18801420#overview)

- Visual Studio  Setup: [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/qeH9Xv_90KM)

Note that don't overstress yourself with the pressure of the development environment setup. Even if it's not successfully setup, you can still program using online compilers like:

- [Repl Online C++ Compiler](https://repl.it/languages/cpp) (Code can be saved once you register for a free account, **recommended**)
- [Programiz Online C++ Compiler](https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/) (Code cannot be saved)

When you ask technical issues, please provide more details when you post the questions. A bad example is that

"XXX does not work, please help". 

You can also insert screenshots or screen recordings when you post an issue on the discussion forums, the screenshots and screen recordings will  make it much easier for others to quickly locate and resolve the issue for you.

To attach screenshots or images in issue, all you need to do is to drag and release. You can follow the instruction here:

https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests

For screen recording, I recommend you to upload to a cloud service like google drive or one drive or even youtube, and insert the link to the issue.
